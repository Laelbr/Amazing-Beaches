  <p>History:</p>
   <p>Hawaiʻi is said to have been named after Hawaiʻiloa, the legendary Polynesian navigator who first discovered it. Other accounts attribute the name to the legendary realm of Hawaiki, a place from which some Polynesian people are said to have originated, the place where they go in the afterlife, or the realm of the gods and goddesses. Captain James Cook, the English explorer and navigator who was the captain of the first European expedition that discovered the Hawaiian Islands, called them the "Sandwich Islands" after his patron, the Earl of Sandwich. Cook was killed on the Big Island at Kealakekua Bay on 14 February 1779, in a mêlée which followed the theft of a ship's boat.</p>

    <p>History:</p>
    <p>Navagio Beach (Greek: Ναυάγιο, pronounced [naˈvaʝo]), or Shipwreck Beach, is an exposed cove, sometimes referred to as "Smugglers Cove", on the coast of Zakynthos, in the Ionian Islands of Greece. Navagio Beach was originally known as Agios Georgios. On 2 October 1980, a freightliner, the MV Panagiotis, ran aground in the waters around Zakynthos Island right on Navagio Beach after stormy weather and bad visibility. Many people falsely claim the ship was smuggling contraband cigarettes, wine and women. Although and recently, MV "PANAGIOTIS" Captain Charalambos Kompothekras - Kotsoros released the real story about what happened. The ship was abandoned and still rests buried in the limestone gravel of the beach that now holds the famous nickname Navagio Beach (Shipwreck beach).</p>
    
    <p>Location and Tourism</p>
    <p>Navagio is located on the north-west shore of Zakynthos (Zante), in the Municipality of Elation. The area is defined by its sheer limestone cliffs, white sand beaches, and clear blue water, which attract thousands of tourists yearly. The strip of beach is accessed only by boat. Regular tours to the beach depart from Porto Vromi to the south, and from Agios Nikolaos and Cape Skinari to the north-east. Boats also arrive from the harbour of Zakynthos city.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nissi Beach</strong></p>
  
    
    <p>History:</p>
    <p>Nissi Beach is a well-known beach in the resort of Ayia Napa, Cyprus.The beach stretches for 500 metres and the water is clean enough for the beach to have been awarded blue flag designation.[1] The beach, which runs the length of its own cove, takes its name from the small islet of Nissi (Greek: Νησί) located close to the coast. The uninhabited islet can be easily reached on foot through the shallow waters and its location provides a good shelter for the rest of the beach. The islet is covered with low-level local vegetation. Nissi Beach has become a popular destination for clubbers following live programs transmitted through BBC's Radio 1 Roadshow during the summer tourist season since 2002. Nissi Bay Beach Bar is very popular with locals and tourists alike, playing music throughout the day and organizing events such as foam parties and catwalks with guest DJs. Water sports such as water-skiing and windsurfing are available. There are also two beach volleyball courts open to the public. In 2005, archaeological excavations along the western borders of the bay revealed evidence of fire-lighting equipment dating back 12,000 years, indicating that the area could have been settled by the first humans on the island.</p>
